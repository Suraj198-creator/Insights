I want a concise, professional, highly insightful daily newsletter summarising the top 5 global marketing stories from the past 48 hours, specifically for marketing professionals. Then add a Bonus Round of 5‚Äì7 additional stories.

1. Filter by Topic
Identify and retain only the articles that are related to Marketing. This includes news about:

- Advertising campaigns and media buys
- Brand launches, rebrands, or stunts
- Influencer marketing, social media trends
- Big moves from brands or agencies
- Consumer insights and behaviour
- Marketing tools, platforms, or ad tech updates

Skip articles that don't centre around marketing.

2. Handle Paywalled Links
If any article is from a paywalled website (e.g., AdAge, Bloomberg, WSJ), find an equivalent article covering the same story from a non-paywalled source and update the link.
Check that the link works and loads the article.

If it leads to a "Something went wrong" or error page, replace it with another working version of the same topic from a different site.

3. Remove Duplicates
I will provide a list of article titles that have already been used in past newsletters. Remove any article with a matching title from the JSON object.

4. Return Format
Output a new JSON object with only the relevant, non-duplicate marketing-related articles, like this:
(
  "title": "link",
  "title": "link"
)

Here is the JSON object of articles:
{self.json_result}

Here is the list of previously used article titles:
There are no previously used article titles yet, as this is the first newsletter being created.

Please evaluate and rank the articles I've provided based on how compelling, buzzworthy, and attention-grabbing they are from a marketing perspective. I'm looking for the Top 5 most interesting stories‚Äîthe kind that would spark curiosity, conversation, or shares. Make sure the articles are in English.

If you feel that some of the current articles aren't particularly strong, feel free to search for more interesting marketing-related articles and add them to the pool for consideration. However, please ensure the following:

No paywalls: Only include articles that are freely accessible.

If you find a great article that is behind a paywall, try to locate an alternative non-paywalled version (same title or substantially the same story) and use that version in your evaluation.

Prioritise stories that are:
- Big, eye-catching brand campaigns, launches, or creative stunts
- Surprising moves from major companies (e.g., TikTok, Nike, Amazon, Meta, etc.)
- Major investments, acquisitions, partnerships, or ad spend shifts
- Viral moments, trends, or influencer plays with a wide reach
- New ad tech, creative tools, or experimental formats with real impact
- Bold, weird, or dramatic marketing decisions that spark conversation

Deprioritise or skip:
- Slow-moving policy or legal updates unless they're making headlines
- Think pieces or ethical debates without a clear news hook
- Minor platform changes or tool updates without strategic implications

=== TOP 5 MARKETING STORIES TODAY ===
Rank them from most to least compelling. For each of the Top 5, write a full summary like this:

[Title of Article] ‚Äì (6 mins)
[Link to article]
What's happening?
Explain the who, what, when, where ‚Äî include names of brands, campaign specifics, platforms, creative agencies, timing, spend, etc.

Why does it matter?
Frame the big-picture impact: Is this trend-setting? Changing how marketers work? Creating a new standard for engagement?

Key Insight:
What's the strategic punchline or biggest takeaway? Why should marketers pay attention?

=== BONUS ROUND: OTHER MARKETING NEWS WORTH A LOOK ===
These didn't make the Top 5, but are still interesting and valuable. Around 5‚Äì7 links is ideal.

Coca‚ÄëCola leans on marketing to navigate choppy economic waters in Q2 ‚Äì (2 min)
https://www.marketingdive.com/news/coca-cola-leaned-on-marketing-to-navigate-choppy-economic-waters-in-q2/753702 

What's happening? 
During its Q2 earnings call, Coca‚ÄëCola executives highlighted the relaunch of "Share a Coke" and other global campaigns as key drivers of a 4% volume uptick. The relaunch rolled out across 150 markets with refreshed personalised packaging, integrated social‚Äëfirst activations, OOH (out‚Äëof‚Äëhome) partnerships (e.g., digital billboards in London and Shanghai), and a $50 million global media spend. Early results show a 15% lift in branded search and 20% growth in streaming‚Äëvideo ad recall.

Why does it matter? 
Coca‚ÄëCola's pivot back to ubiquitous, personalisation-driven branding resets the tone for legacy CPG players facing inflation‚Äëweary consumers and intensifying competition from low‚Äëcost private labels. The success in both emerging and mature markets signals enduring loyalty potential‚Äîand offers a playbook for other beverage and FMCG brands to follow.

Key insight: 
Personalisation at scale‚Äîblending packaging, digital, and OOH‚Äîcan reinvigorate heritage brands even amid economic headwinds.

REMEMBER: Clearly separate the TOP 5 STORIES from the BONUS ROUND so they can be properly placed in different sections of the HTML template.

StarkWare unlock sends $750M in STRK to insiders, sparking dump fears ‚Äì The Block, July 26, 2025 ‚Äì (4 min)
https://www.theblock.co/post/xyz/starkware-token-unlock-fears
What‚Äôs happening?
StarkWare released 64 million STRK tokens (~$750M) to early contributors and investors, triggering a 12% price drop overnight. The unlock represents 13% of the total supply and comes amid low liquidity and weak demand.
Why does it matter?
Token unlocks often pressure price, but this size and timing could destabilise confidence in L2S more broadly. Some investors are calling for revised token schedules and governance accountability.
Key Insight:
Tokenomics design is being tested‚Äîunlocks without demand or transparency can rattle ecosystems.
